## 📦 API Endpoints Overview

### 🔐 Authentication

- `POST /auth/register` — Register a new user  
- `POST /auth/login` — Authenticate and receive JWT token  

### 👤 User

- `GET /me` — Retrieve authenticated user details  
- `DELETE /me` — Remove authenticated user and all his expenses

### 💸 Expenses

- `GET /expense/{expense_id}` — Get specific expense  
- `GET /expenses` — List all expenses  
- `POST /expense` — Add a new expense  
- `PUT /expense/{expense_id}` — Update an existing expense  
- `DELETE /expense/{expense_id}` — Delete an expense  
- `GET /expenses/search?query=...` — Search by text  
- `GET /expenses/search/regex?pattern=...&flags=...` — Search by regex  

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLModel  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Auth**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- **Migrations**: Alembic  
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose  

## 🛠️ Development

For local development without Docker, install dependencies and run manually (but you need to have running database and .env file for it):

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### ✅ Running Tests

After adding or modifying a feature, **make sure to run tests** to verify that the application's functionality is not broken:

```bash
pytest
```

Tests require a **separate test database** to run correctly.  
Before running tests, create a test database manually (e.g. `expense_tracker_test`) and add a `.env.test` file in the root directory it should consist of one variable TEST_DB_URL with url for your test database:

```env
# .env.test
TEST_DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://test_user:test_password@localhost:5432/expense_tracker_test
```

> You can change the URL according to your environment or Docker test setup.
